# Cryptocurrency-Price-prediction-using-ML

This project aims to predict the future price of a cryptocurrency using machine learning techniques. The project uses historical price data of the cryptocurrency to train a machine learning model, which is then used to make predictions about the future price of the cryptocurrency.

## REQUIREMENTS:
To run this project, you need to have the following installed on your machine:

     Python 3

     Jupyter Notebook

     Visual Studio Code

Required python libraries such as pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, matplotlib, tensorflow, keras.


##  GETTING STARTED:

    1. Clone the repository to your local machine.

    2. Open the project directory in Visual Studio Code.

    3. Open a terminal window in Visual Studio Code and navigate to the project directory.

    4. Create a virtual environment by running the following command:

          'python -m venv env'
      
    5. Activate the virtual environment by running the following command:

          'source env/bin/activate (for mac/linux)'

          'env\Scripts\activate.bat (for windows)'

    6. Install the required python libraries by running the following command: 

          'pip install -r requirements.txt'
  
  
  
    7. Start Jupyter Notebook by running the following command:

          'jupyter notebook'

    8. In Jupyter Notebook, open the cryptocurrency_price_prediction.ipynb file.

    9. Follow the instructions in the notebook to train the machine learning model and make predictions about the future price of the cryptocurrency.


## COMMANDS:
